The "Call for Speakers‚Äù is now closed, and we have received 68 submissions! Currently the papers undergo a review process by our program committee, which was boosted by the help of additional volunteering reviewers: Sasha Goldshtein, Pavel Yosifovich, Simon Brand, Avi Lachmish and Christopher Di Bella.

The program is yet to be built, but we already understand, with great excitement and a little sadness, that we will not be able to accept many great sessions because the amount of high-quality submissions is so large. At the same time we are confident that we will be able to carve a fabulous program covering a wide range of C++ topics.

But, of course, the secret ingredient in making Core C++ conference an unforgettable event is you! Join us to learn, connect, share ideas and have fun :)
