Happy to announce the Teaching C++ Workshop co-hosted with the Core C++ conference. The Teaching C++ Workshop will focus on specific issues related to Teaching C++ but is open for practitioners who want to influence the way C++ is being taught. 

Workshop is on Thursday 16.5 afternoon and Friday 17.5 morning, note that tickets bought for the Core C++ conferences cover also the workshop so you only have to register to reserve a seat in the workshop.
