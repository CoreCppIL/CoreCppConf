We're very excited to announce **Core C++ 2019** - a new C++ conference taking place at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo in Israel on May 14-17 2019. The conference is aimed at C++ developers and practitioners as well as academic researchers and teachers who wish to be updated by the newest developments of C++ and present their work with C++. 

From medical devices and flash storage to CPUs and advanced navigation systems, Israeli innovation pushes the boundaries of the imagination. Advanced software is at the heart of many of these systems, and when it comes to bare-metal performance, low power consumption, high speed responses and massive scalability - C++ is king.
