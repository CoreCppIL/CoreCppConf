We have exciting news - Bjarne Stroustrup will be the first keynote speaker of the Core C++ 2020 conference! This is a great step forward for the conference and the Israeli C++ community, and there is certainly more to come. The call for submissions is open until Feb. 15, early bird discounts are available and we're looking for more sponsors. The low sponsorship levels are merely buying a few tickets, so sending devs to the conference and being a sponsor is like peanut butter and jelly - good apart, even better together!
