The Call for Speakers for **Core C++ 2019** is now open, [submit yours now](https://bit.ly/cpp2019)!   

**Submission Deadline** is **Jan. 15th 2019**.

From medical devices and flash storage to CPUs and advanced navigation systems, Israeli innovation pushes the boundaries of the imagination. Advanced software is at the heart of many of these systems, and when it comes to bare-metal performance, low power-consumption and massive scalability, C++ is king.
